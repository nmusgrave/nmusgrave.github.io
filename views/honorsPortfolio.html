				<h1>Sophomore</h1>
				<h3>Fall</h3>
				<p><strong>Goal: </strong>get technical internship for summer 2014</p>
				<p><strong>Learned: </strong>I am in control of my own happiness</p>
				<p><strong>Achieved: </strong>accepted internship offer from Intel</p>
				<p><strong>Courses: </strong>CSE311, ME123, CSE390, ESS102</p>
				<h4>Design principles</h4>
				<p>
					I signed up for an introductory Mechanical Engineering class for fall quarter. I'd missed
					working on visual projects, and was looking forward to learning about CAD. The courses'
					lectures covered industry standards and terminology, with lab time for using CAD software.
					By the end of the course, I was using Soldworks to model the Atlas helicopter, a bicycle-
					powered helicopter.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the beginning of the quarter I would leap in and start modeling right away. This
					approach was fine initially, but projects quickly became more demanding.
					The decisions I made early on heavily influenced how easily I could correct mistakes.
					By tying a component's references to certain objects, I would severely limit my ability to
					re-size and manipulate that piece several steps down the line.
				</p>
				<p>
					After struggling with the ramifications of my headfirst strategy, I realized
					my original approach was not scaling with the complexity of the homework assignments.
					I realized I needed to make deliberate decisions about my models' structure.
					I forced myself to slow down. Analyzing the model before jumping into the software,
					I would build a mental road map for which components formed the underlying structure,
					how they should relate to each other, and how other parts should relate to the base form.
					The initial time investment paid off since I spent far less time debugging later in the
					construction. 
				</p>
				<p>
					These two principles, planning before building and simplifying object relationships, are
					critical in computer science. The code I wrote before and after fall quarter shifted in
					quality as I applied these concepts. I am able to develop maintainable code more quickly.
					When I noticed the connection between CAD modeling and software design, I realized these
					concepts can be applied to almost any field.
